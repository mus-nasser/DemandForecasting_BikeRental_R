# DemandForecasting_BikeRental_R
**Project Objective**
The project aims to help forecast the demand for the bike-sharing company based on the number of available attributes given in the data. This should help them to create an inventory and workforce-related strategy apart from financial and maintenance estimates. Also, because of the improving bike-sharing culture, the project can have an indirect impact on promoting health, environment, and other social impacts on society

**Data Understanding:** The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants were asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand for the data came from a two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which was obtained by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dimensions of our dataset are 731 observations for 16 variables.
